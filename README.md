# PCPad v0.3
This software allows users to control their PC with an Xbox controller pad as an alternative to a mouse and keyboard.

PCPad is currently in the very early stages of its development so many features have not yet been implemented, currently you can only control the mouse cursor using the left analog stick and left click with the A button, but there are many more features yet to come.
